## About the project
Burger is a full-stack application deployed on heroku and using heroku database. Records stored in db are dynamically written out on the webpage using handlebars.
## Usage  
### Installation   
The burger app is deployed on heroku and can be accessed directly. The code can be seen in the github repo.    
Access the app via heroku deployed link: [https://stormy-everglades-61570.herokuapp.com/
](https://stormy-everglades-61570.herokuapp.com/).    
The repo with code on github: [https://github.com/PavN93/Burger](https://github.com/PavN93/Burger).
### How to use?
The user can input the name of the burger to be ordered (or devoured right away) into text area. After pressing button related to requested action, the app will save it in order list or devoured list. Burgers from both lists can be also modified independently by using attached buttons.

## Improvements
* I do not like the layout, colors and the overall aesthetics of the frontend. I wish to redesign it at some point.    
* The code can be refactored for more reusability and overall improvement of performance (re-rendering the results instead of full reload would be a point to start).
